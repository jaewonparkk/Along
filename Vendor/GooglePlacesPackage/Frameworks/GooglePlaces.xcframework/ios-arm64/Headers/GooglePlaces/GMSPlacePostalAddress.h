/**
 * Unstructured address lines describing the lower levels of an address.
 *
 * Because values in `address_lines` do not have type information and may sometimes
 * contain multiple values in a single field (for example, "Austin, TX"), it is
 * important that the line order is clear. The order of address lines should be
 * "envelope order" for the country or region of the address. In places where this
 * can vary (for example, Japan), `address_language` is used
 * to make it explicit (for example, "ja" for large-to-small ordering and "ja-Latn" or
 * "en" for small-to-large). In this way, the most specific line of an address can be
 * selected based on the language.
 *
 * The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists of a
 * `region_code` with all remaining information placed in the `address_lines`.
 * It would be possible to format such an address very approximately without
 * geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made about any of the address
 * components until it was at least partially resolved.
 *
 * Creating an address only containing a `region_code` and `address_lines` and then
 * geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as
 * opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities or
 * administrative areas).
